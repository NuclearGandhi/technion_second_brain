# Introduction
## Embedded systems
An embedded system could be a battery-powered processor cast in a small plastic capsule, a few $\pu{mm}$ in size.
A pressure sensor and an accelerometer embedded in the capsule transmit data to remove server wirelessly.

Embedded system contains the following general components:
- **sensors** - 
- **actuators** -


## STM 32
In this course we will focusing our learning on the STM32, which are a family of 32-bit microprocessors and microcontroller integrated circuits from the company STMicroelectronics. The reasons we are learning about it are:
- They offer industry-grade performance and reliability.
- The come with a rich development ecosystem - STM32CubeIDE, STM32CubeMX, HAL libraries.
- They are affordable and scalable.
