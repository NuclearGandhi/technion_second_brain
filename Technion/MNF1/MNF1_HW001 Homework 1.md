## Question 1
You need to produce a pedal for aircraft steering. Choose two processes that can fit - one from the _casting_ process group and the other from the _bulk deformation_ processing group.

### Part a
Select the processes and justify your choice (list technological advantages of the chosen processes: each one from its group).

**Solution**:
Here are a couple of suitable processes (one [[MNF1_002 Metal Casting|casting process]], and one [[MNF1_003 Bulk Deformation Processes|bulk deformation process]]):
1. **Low pressure permanent mold casting**: the dimensional accuracy offered by this process is superior, making it suitable for the pedal component, that has to meet exact specifications; it is also suitable for producing a large quantity of components.
2. **Forging**: In forging, the grain structure is strong; it also has good resistance to fatigue relevant for parts subjected to repeated stresses like a steering pedal on an airplane.

### Part b
Make a qualitative comparison between the selected processes.

**Solution**:

|                          | Low Pressure Permanent Mold Casting                               | Forging                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strength**             | Good, but generally lower than forged parts                       | Excellent, due to grain alignment and deformation                  |
| **Surface Finish**       | Better than sand casting, may still require some finishing        | Usually requires machining, but can achieve good finishes          |
| **Complexity of Shapes** | Best for relatively simple to moderately complex shapes           | Best for simple to moderately complex shapes                       |
| **Production Volume**    | Suitable for medium to high volume production                     | Applied to low and high volume, but high setup cost for low volume |
| **Cost**                 | High initial setup cost, but lower cost per part in large volumes | High initial setup cost, and higher cost per part in large volumes |

### Part c
Select the preferable process from the two processes you have chosen and compared previously, and justify your choice.

**Solution**:
I chose Forging for the following reason:
- **Strength**: Forging makes the part very strong. This thing is really very important for an aircraft steering pedal as it has to bear a lot of stress. 
- **Durability and Toughness**: Forged parts are more durable and tough. They can handle impacts and won't wear out quickly, which is required for a part that is used a lot.
- **Fatigue Resistance**: The forging process yields excellent fatigue resistance. Since the pedal will be used time after time, it needs to withstand constant use without failing.



## Question 2
Consider an _economical_ aspect of a manufacturing. Assume that the pedal (see the previous question) is made by _casting_. Which casting process would you choose if you had to produce: 
1.      Series of 5 discs?
2.      Series of 100 disks?
3.      Series of 1000 disks?
4.      Series of 10000 disks?
5.      Series of 100,000 disks?
What are the _technological_ disadvantages of each casting process from the processes you have chosen?

**Solution**:

1. Series of 5 Discs: Sand Casting
	Its technological disadvantages are :
    - Dimensional accuracy and surface finish is lower than other methods.
    - Greater porosity and defects
    - Large amount of post-processing like machining and finishing is required.

2. Series of 100 Discs: Shell Mold Casting
	Its technological disadvantages are :
    - Initial cost for the metal patterns are higher.
	- Limited to small to medium size components.

3. Series of 1,000 Discs: Investment Casting
    its technological disadvantages are:
     - High production cost due to labor-intensive process.
     - Time-consuming since a lot of steps are involved in preparation of wax pattern and building up the ceramic shell.
     - Limited only to small parts since the ceramic shell used may be fragile, which limits it to making small components only.
  
4. **Series of 10,000 discs: Low-Pressure Casting**
	Its technological disadvantages are: 
    - High initial set-up cost for equipment
    - Limited to alloy types since some alloys require a lot of pressure
    - Needs precise control of pressure and temperature to ensure quality​.

5. **Series of 100,000 discs: Die Casting**
	its technological disadvantages: 
    - High initial cost for dies and equipment: very high.
    - Restricted only to non-ferrous metals like aluminum, zinc, and magnesium.
    - Risk of air entrapment and porosity in the final product.
