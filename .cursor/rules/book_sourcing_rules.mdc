# Book Sourcing Rules

## General Sourcing Guidelines
- Use consistent citation format: `[[Course_000 Course Name#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author et al., Year)]]`
- Maintain a consistent style for all citations throughout the document
- When translating content from Hebrew to English, maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy
- For bilingual content, use `>[!def] Definition:` for English and `>[!def] הגדרה:` for Hebrew
- **Always use precise technical terminology in Hebrew** (e.g., use 'הדקים' instead of 'טרמינלים', 'מתח ההדקים', 'זרם ההדקים', etc.)
- Use consistent variable names and notation as in the original source, unless a specific correction is required
- When referencing internal sections, use proper Obsidian cross-links (e.g., `[[#Section Name]]`)

## Figure Citations
- For figures from books, use the format: `![[filename.png|bookhue|size]]`
- Add a caption below each figure starting with ">" and including the source
- Example: `>Figure caption. [[Course_000 Course Name#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author et al., Year)]].`
- For figures from the same book, you can reference the same source multiple times
- Include figure numbers from the original book when available

## Content Attribution
- When directly quoting or closely paraphrasing book content, cite the source
- For adapted or modified content, indicate this in the text or notes
- When combining information from multiple sources, cite all relevant sources
- For translated content, maintain the original structure and formatting
- Use consistent terminology across translations

## Mathematical Content
- When presenting theorems, definitions, or equations from books:
  - Use the original numbering if available
  - Maintain the original notation unless there's a specific reason to change it
  - For equations, use proper LaTeX formatting with `$` for inline and `$$` for display
  - Use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` for multi-line equations
  - **Always use the correct variable names and technical terms as in the source (e.g., $V_t$ for מתח ההדקים, not 'טרמינלים')**
  - For cross-references to equations or sections, use Obsidian links
- For proofs and derivations:
  - Indicate if the proof has been modified or adapted
  - Maintain the original logical flow
  - Use proper mathematical notation and symbols

## Examples and Exercises
- When using examples from books:
  - Indicate if the example has been modified
  - Use `>[!example] Example:` for English and `>[!example] דוגמה:` for Hebrew
  - Include complete solutions with proper mathematical formatting
  - Use `**Solution:**` or `**פתרון:**` before solutions
- For exercises:
  - Maintain original numbering if available

## Cross-References
- When referencing content from other parts of the same book:
  - Use the format `[[Chapter Name#Section Name]]`
  - Include specific equation or figure numbers when relevant
- When referencing content from different books:
  - Use the full citation format
  - Include specific page numbers or section references
- For internal links, use proper Obsidian link format

## Translation and Adaptation
- When translating content from books:
  - Maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy
  - Indicate if the translation is your own
  - Cite the original source
  - Keep consistent terminology across translations
  - **Always use the correct Hebrew technical terms and variable names**
- When adapting content:
  - Clearly indicate what has been modified
  - Maintain the original structure where possible
  - Cite the original source
  - Use proper bilingual formatting

## Tables and Data
- For tables from books:
  - Include a caption with the source
  - Maintain the original formatting where possible
  - Use proper LaTeX formatting for mathematical content
- For data from books:
  - Cite the source of the data
  - Indicate if the data has been modified or updated
  - Include relevant units and measurement methods

## Code and Algorithms
- When presenting code or algorithms from books:
  - Indicate if the code has been modified
  - Include any relevant implementation notes
  - Use proper code formatting and syntax highlighting
  - Include comments explaining key steps

## Units and Measurements
- Use `\pu{...}` for physical units
- Maintain consistent unit notation throughout the document
- Include units in all numerical values

## Document Structure
- Include aliases for important terms
- **Review and update all content for terminology, variable names, and formatting before finalizing**
