# Book Sourcing Rules

## General Sourcing Guidelines
- Use consistent citation format: `[[Course_000 Course Name#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author et al., Year)]]`
- Maintain a consistent style for all citations throughout the document
- When translating content from Hebrew to English, maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy
- For bilingual content, use `>[!def] Definition:` for English and `>[!def] הגדרה:` for Hebrew
- **Always use precise technical terminology in Hebrew** (e.g., use 'הדקים' instead of 'טרמינלים', 'מתח ההדקים', 'זרם ההדקים', etc.)
- Use consistent variable names and notation as in the original source, unless a specific correction is required
- When referencing internal sections, use proper Obsidian cross-links (e.g., `[[#Section Name]]`)

## Mathematical Notation and Formatting Rules

### Derivative Notation
- **ALWAYS use `\mathrm{d}` for differential operator**, not `d`
- Correct: `\frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}x}`, `\mathrm{d}A`, `\mathrm{d}x`
- Incorrect: `\frac{dw}{dx}`, `dA`, `dx`

### Equation Formatting
- Use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` for multi-line equations with alignment
- Use `\begin{align}...\end{align}` for numbered multi-line equations
- Use `\begin{gather}...\end{gather}` for multi-line equations without alignment
- **Prefer `aligned` over separate single-line equations when showing derivation steps**
- Use `\\[1ex]`, `\\[2ex]`, `\\[3ex]` for proper vertical spacing between lines
- Use `&` for alignment points in aligned environments

### Equation Numbering and References
- Use descriptive equation tags with prefixes (e.g., `\tag{RJ5.1}`, `\tag{ZT6.1}`)
- **Reference equations using `$\text{(RJ5.1)}$` format, not `(RJ5.1)` alone**
- Keep equation numbering sequential and logical
- Restart numbering for each major section if needed

### Figure References and Anchors
- **Always add anchor tags to figures**: `^figure-descriptive-name`
- Use internal links for figure references: `[[#^figure-name|איור]]`
- Example: `![[filename.png|bookhue|600]]^figure-beam-kinematics`
- Reference format: `כפי שמוצג ב[[#^figure-general-beam|איור]]`

## Figure Citations
- For figures from books, use the format: `![[{GUID}.png|bookhue|size]]^anchor-name`
- Add a caption below each figure starting with ">" and including the source
- **Remove redundant figure numbers from captions** - let the anchor handle identification
- Example: `>קינמטיקה של דפורמציה של קורה לפי השערת אויילר-ברנולי. [[Course_000#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author, Year)]].`
- For figures from the same book, you can reference the same source multiple times
- Include figure numbers from the original book when available

## Content Attribution
- When directly quoting or closely paraphrasing book content, cite the source
- For adapted or modified content, indicate this in the text or notes
- When combining information from multiple sources, cite all relevant sources
- For translated content, maintain the original structure and formatting
- Use consistent terminology across translations

## Mathematical Content
- When presenting theorems, definitions, or equations from books:
  - Use the original numbering if available, but adapt with prefixes when needed
  - Maintain the original notation unless there's a specific reason to change it
  - For equations, use proper LaTeX formatting with `$` for inline and `$$` for display
  - Use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` for multi-line equations
  - **Always use `\mathrm{d}` for differential operators**
  - **Always use the correct variable names and technical terms as in the source**
  - For cross-references to equations or sections, use `$\text{(equation)}$` format
- For proofs and derivations:
  - Indicate if the proof has been modified or adapted
  - Maintain the original logical flow
  - Use proper mathematical notation and symbols

## Hebrew Technical Terminology
- **Remove unnecessary unit specifications** from mathematical content when they don't add value
- **Use Hebrew for section headings and technical terms**, maintain English abbreviations in parentheses when needed

## Examples and Exercises
- When using examples from books:
  - Indicate if the example has been modified
  - Use `>[!example] Example:` for English and `>[!example] דוגמה:` for Hebrew
  - Include complete solutions with proper mathematical formatting
  - Use `**Solution:**` or `**פתרון:**` before solutions
- For exercises:
  - Maintain original numbering if available

## Cross-References
- When referencing content from other parts of the same book:
  - Use the format `[[Chapter Name#Section Name]]` or `[[#^anchor|text]]`
  - Include specific equation or figure numbers when relevant
- When referencing content from different books:
  - Use the full citation format
  - Include specific page numbers or section references
- For internal links, use proper Obsidian link format

## Translation and Adaptation
- When translating content from books:
  - Maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy
  - Indicate if the translation is your own
  - Cite the original source
  - Keep consistent terminology across translations
  - **Always use the correct Hebrew technical terms and variable names**
- When adapting content:
  - Clearly indicate what has been modified
  - Maintain the original structure where possible
  - Cite the original source
  - Use proper bilingual formatting

## Tables and Data
- For tables from books:
  - Include a caption with the source
  - Maintain the original formatting where possible
  - Use proper LaTeX formatting for mathematical content
- For data from books:
  - Cite the source of the data
  - Indicate if the data has been modified or updated

3. **Never create figures without anchor tags**
4. **Never use inconsistent Hebrew technical terminology**
5. **Never separate multi-line equations when they should be in aligned environments**
6. **Never include unnecessary unit specifications in mathematical descriptions**

## Advanced Mathematical Formatting Rules

### Variable and Subscript Formatting
- **For variables with subscripts that are squared or powered**, use triple braces: `{{{V}_{1}}}^{2}` instead of `V_1^2`
- **For complex impedance calculations**, use polar form when appropriate: `\pu {0.5 \angle 53.13^{\circ} \Omega }`
- **Always explain subscript meanings** when introducing new notation: "כאשר $d$ הוא עבור developed ו-$m$ הוא עבור max."

### Multi-Step Calculations and Definitions
- **Use aligned environments for variable definitions**, even simple ones:
  ```latex
  $$\begin{aligned}
   & R_e = R_1 + R_2 \\[1ex]
   & X_e = X_1 + X_2
  \end{aligned}$$
  ```
- **For multi-step calculations**, always use aligned format:
  ```latex
  $$\begin{aligned}
   \omega_m  & = (1-s_p)\omega_s  \\[1ex]
    & = (1-0.286) \times 125.66  \\[1ex]
    & = 89.72\,\pu{rad/s}
  \end{aligned}$$
  ```
- **For impedance calculations**, show step-by-step with aligned format and include both rectangular and polar forms

### Figure Reference Accuracy
- **Always verify figure anchor names** match the actual context being discussed
- **Use the most relevant figure** for the current section (e.g., use approximate equivalent circuit figure when discussing approximate analysis)
- **Double-check figure references** before finalizing content

### Language Consistency in Mathematical Context
- **Use "or" instead of "או"** in mathematical equations and numerical results
- **Use "or" for alternative units or values**: `1200\,\pu{rpm} \quad \text{or} \quad 125.66\,\pu{rad/s}`
- **Reserve "או" for Hebrew textual explanations** outside of mathematical expressions

### Unit Formatting Standards
- **For torque units**, use `\pu{N . m}` (with space-dot-space) instead of `\pu{N \cdot m}`
- **For angular units**, use standard notation: `\pu{rad/s}`, `\pu{rpm}`
- **For electrical units**, maintain consistency: `\pu{V}`, `\pu{A}`, `\pu{W}`, `\pu{kW}`

### Cross-Reference Guidelines
- **Avoid external course references** unless absolutely necessary and verified to exist
- **Remove references to other courses** (e.g., PHY2_004) unless they are confirmed to be available in the current context
- **Focus on internal consistency** within the current document/course

### Professional Mathematical Presentation
- **Always use proper mathematical spacing** with `\,` for thousands separators in results
- **Include units with all numerical answers** in examples
- **Show intermediate steps** in aligned format for complex calculations
- **Use consistent decimal precision** throughout calculations (typically 2-3 significant figures for final answers)

### Example Problem Formatting
- **Structure solutions with clear steps**: calculation setup, intermediate steps, final answer
- **Use aligned equations for all multi-step work**
- **Include unit analysis** where appropriate
- **End with boxed or clearly marked final answers** when appropriate

## Quality Control Checklist
Before finalizing any mathematical content, verify:
- [ ] All variables with subscripts use proper triple-brace formatting when powered
- [ ] Multi-step calculations use aligned environments
- [ ] Figure references match the actual content being discussed
- [ ] "or" is used in mathematical contexts, "או" in Hebrew text
- [ ] Units follow established formatting (N . m for torque, etc.)
