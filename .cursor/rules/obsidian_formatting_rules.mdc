# Markdown formatting

## General - Obsidian Markdown
- Use "$" for inline math and "$$" for math blocks
- When you respond in the cursor chat, use cursor math chat syntax, so it is readable in cursor.
- Do not put Hebrew text inside math blocks or math inline
- Put definitions, examples, notes and so forth in callouts
- Reference local links using [[]] and not []()
- Each image (callouts are exempt, but still desirable) should have a caption
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for main headings, ## for subheadings, etc.)
- For exercises, use "# תרגילים" as the section heading with "## שאלה n" for individual problems
- For multiple-part questions, use "### סעיף א'" format for each part
- Use proper spacing between sections (one blank line between sections)
- Use proper tab indentation for nested lists and content
- If after a bold text there is `:`, place it outside of the bold marks.

## Mathematical Content and Theorems
- Use `>[!def] הגדרה:` for definitions
- Use `>[!theorem] משפט:` for theorems
- Use `>[!example] דוגמאות:` for examples
- Use `>[!notes] הערות:` for notes
- Use `>[!info] מסקנה:` for corollaries or conclusions
- Use `>[!quote]` for quotes
- Place mathematical proofs after theorem statements, ending with "$\blacksquare$"
- For multi-step calculations, use aligned environments: `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}`
- Include appropriate references using bibliography notation: `[[Course_000 Course Name#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author et al., Year)]]`

## Equation Formatting
- For equations that need numbering, use `\tag{n.m}` at the end of the equation
- For multi-line equations, use `\\[1ex]` for medium line spacing and `\\[2ex]` or `\\[3ex]` for larger spacing
- Use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` for aligned calculations
- Use `\boxed{...}` to highlight important results or final answers
- For matrices, use `\begin{pmatrix}...\end{pmatrix}` format
- When using equation arrays, properly align entries with `&` symbol
- Include footnotes for clarifying mathematical notation with `[^n]` syntax
- Multiplying between numerical values should be done with `\cdot`, not `\times` or `(num1)(num)2`

## Document Structure
- Start content files with YAML frontmatter including aliases
- Place images in their appropriate context with proper captions using `|bookhue` or `|book` for textbook images
- For solutions, precede the answer with "**פתרון**:" or "**Solution**:"
- When showing a calculation process, use proper equation alignment with `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}`
- End calculations with boxed answers: `\boxed{result}`
- For diagrams, use Excalidraw and embed SVG files
- Structure sections with proper headings using Markdown heading syntax
- For exercises, use "# תרגילים" as the section heading with "## שאלה n" for individual problems
- For multiple-part questions, use "### סעיף א'" format for each part
- Use proper spacing between sections and subsections
- Use proper indentation for nested content

## Algorithm and Special Content
- Use `#אלגוריתם:` for algorithm descriptions
- For vector and matrix notation, use `\mathbf{x}` for vectors and `[\mathbf{A}]` for matrices
- When using special units, wrap them in `\pu{...}` for proper formatting
- For references to figures, use the format `![[filename.svg]]` with a caption line below starting with ">"
- Use proper spacing between algorithm steps and sections

## Graphs and Figures
- Use LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions in graph labels, legends, and titles
- Use the default color scheme for all graphs, and maintain consistency in color usage across figures
- By default, export figures at a resolution of 600x400 pixels, unless the figure contains a large amount of data that requires a larger size
- Include proper captions for all figures using the format `>Figure caption. [[Course_000 Course Name#ביבליוגרפיה|(Author et al., Year)]].`
- Use `|bookhue` for textbook images and `|book` for other book images
- Specify image size in pixels when needed (e.g., `|bookhue|500`)

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

## Content Structure and Organization
- **DO NOT add titles or section headings that weren't in the original text** - stick to the original structure and organization
- **DO NOT create unnecessary callout blocks** - only use them when the original text specifically defines terms, states theorems, provides clear examples, etc.
- **When using callout blocks in English text, use English titles** (e.g., `>[!def] Definition:` not `>[!def] הגדרה:`)
- **Always include figure placeholders and captions** when the original text references figures
- **Reference figures appropriately** in the flowing text (e.g., "as illustrated in Figure X.Y" or "see Figure X.Y")

## Figure Handling
- Include proper figure placeholders using format: `![[Figure X.Y placeholder.png|bookhue|600]]` when figures are mentioned but not provided
- Always include figure captions below images using the format: `>Caption text. [[Source reference]]`
- Reference figures in the text flow where they are mentioned
- Use consistent image sizing (typically 600px width for main figures)
- Leave appropriate space and context for figures to be inserted

## Language Consistency
- When content is primarily in English, use English callout titles
- When content is primarily in Hebrew, use Hebrew callout titles
- Match the language of callout blocks to the language of the surrounding content
